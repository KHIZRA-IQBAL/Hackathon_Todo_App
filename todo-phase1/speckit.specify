# Requirements Specification
# Hackathon Todo App - Phase I

## Overview
A simple, in-memory console-based todo list application that allows users to manage tasks through a command-line interface.

## User Stories

### US-1: Add New Task
**As a** user
**I want to** add a new task with a title and description
**So that** I can track things I need to do

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can enter a task title (required)
- User can enter a task description (required)
- Task is assigned a unique ID automatically
- Task is created with status "incomplete" by default
- User sees confirmation message with task ID
- Empty title or description should be rejected with clear error message

### US-2: View All Tasks
**As a** user
**I want to** see all my tasks in a list
**So that** I can review what needs to be done

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Display all tasks in a readable format
- Show task ID, title, description, and completion status
- Indicate which tasks are complete vs incomplete (visual indicator)
- Show message if no tasks exist
- List should be easy to scan

### US-3: Update Task
**As a** user
**I want to** update a task's title or description
**So that** I can correct or clarify task information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can select task by ID
- User can update title, description, or both
- Original values are shown before update
- User can choose to keep original value unchanged
- Confirmation shown after successful update
- Error shown if task ID doesn't exist

### US-4: Delete Task
**As a** user
**I want to** delete a task
**So that** I can remove tasks I no longer need

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can select task by ID
- System shows task details before deletion
- User must confirm deletion
- Task is permanently removed from list
- Confirmation shown after successful deletion
- Error shown if task ID doesn't exist

### US-5: Mark Task Complete/Incomplete
**As a** user
**I want to** mark tasks as complete or incomplete
**So that** I can track my progress

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can toggle task status by ID
- System shows current status before toggle
- Status changes from incomplete to complete or vice versa
- Visual confirmation of new status
- Error shown if task ID doesn't exist

### US-6: Main Menu Navigation
**As a** user
**I want to** navigate through a clear menu system
**So that** I can easily access all features

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Main menu shows all available options
- Each option is numbered clearly
- User can select option by number
- Invalid selections show helpful error message
- User can exit the application cleanly
- After each operation, user returns to main menu

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Task Data Model
Each task must contain:
- `id`: Unique integer identifier (auto-generated)
- `title`: String (max 100 characters, required)
- `description`: String (max 500 characters, required)
- `completed`: Boolean (default: False)

### FR-2: Task Storage
- Tasks stored in memory (Python list or dictionary)
- Data persists only during application runtime
- Data is lost when application exits

### FR-3: Input Validation
- All user inputs must be validated
- Empty or whitespace-only inputs rejected
- Non-numeric input for ID selection rejected
- Clear error messages for all validation failures

### FR-4: User Interface
- Console-based menu system
- Clear prompts for user input
- Formatted output for task lists
- Visual distinction between complete/incomplete tasks
- Consistent formatting throughout application

### FR-5: Error Handling
- Handle invalid menu selections
- Handle non-existent task IDs
- Handle invalid input types
- No application crashes
- All errors show helpful messages

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance
- All operations complete in < 1 second
- Instant menu navigation
- Immediate visual feedback

### NFR-2: Usability
- No external documentation needed for basic use
- Intuitive menu labels
- Clear action prompts
- Obvious way to exit

### NFR-3: Maintainability
- Clean code structure
- Separation of UI and business logic
- Functions with single responsibility
- Consistent naming conventions

### NFR-4: Compatibility
- Works on Python 3.8+
- Cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- No special environment setup required

## Out of Scope (Future Phases)

The following are explicitly OUT of scope for Phase I:
- Persistent storage (file/database)
- Task priorities or categories
- Due dates or reminders
- Search or filter functionality
- Multi-user support
- Web interface or API
- Task history or audit log
- Data export/import

## Acceptance Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path - Complete Workflow
1. User starts application
2. User adds 3 tasks
3. User views all tasks
4. User marks task #2 as complete
5. User updates task #1 description
6. User deletes task #3
7. User views all tasks (should show tasks #1 and #2)
8. User exits application

### Scenario 2: Input Validation
1. User tries to add task with empty title → Error shown
2. User tries to update non-existent task ID → Error shown
3. User enters invalid menu option → Error shown
4. User enters letter when ID expected → Error shown

### Scenario 3: Edge Cases
1. User views tasks when list is empty → Appropriate message shown
2. User deletes all tasks → Can still add new tasks
3. User toggles same task multiple times → Status changes each time

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Application runs without crashes
- [ ] All input validation working
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Code passes all acceptance test scenarios
- [ ] Code is clean and maintainable
- [ ] README documents how to run the application
