# Project Constitution
# Hackathon Todo App - Phase I

## Core Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
- This is Phase I: Build the simplest possible working version
- In-memory storage only (no database, no file persistence)
- Console-based interface (no web UI, no GUI)
- Minimal dependencies (Python standard library preferred)

### 2. Data Integrity
- Each task must have a unique identifier
- Task state must be consistent throughout operations
- No data loss during the runtime session

### 3. User Experience
- Clear, intuitive menu system
- Immediate feedback for all operations
- Graceful error handling with helpful messages
- Easy navigation between features

### 4. Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data management)
- Readable, maintainable code
- Proper error handling
- Clear function and variable names

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Storage**: In-memory only (data lost on exit)
- **Interface**: Console/Terminal only
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies

### Scope Constraints - Phase I Only
- ✅ In scope: Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete/Incomplete
- ❌ Out of scope: Persistence, multi-user, authentication, due dates, priorities, categories
- ❌ Out of scope: Web interface, API, database

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Instant response for all operations (in-memory)
- **Reliability**: No crashes, graceful error handling
- **Usability**: Anyone should be able to use without documentation
- **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to extend for Phase II

## Design Philosophy

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Don't add features for "future phases"
- Don't over-engineer the architecture
- Focus on making Phase I work perfectly

### Progressive Enhancement
- Build solid foundation that CAN be extended
- But don't implement extension points yet
- Phase II will add persistence, Phase III will add web interface

### Fail Fast
- Validate input immediately
- Show clear error messages
- Don't let invalid state propagate

## Success Criteria

A successful Phase I implementation:
1. Runs without crashes
2. Allows all CRUD operations on tasks
3. Has clear, usable console interface
4. Can be demonstrated in 5 minutes
5. Code is clean enough for Phase II extension
